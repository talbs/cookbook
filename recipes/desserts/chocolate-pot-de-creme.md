## Directions

### Pot De Creme

1. Fill sous vide container with water full enough for circulator to operate properly.
2. Add circulator into water and set circulator temperature to 158°F / 70°C.
3. Separate egg yolks from whites (keeping whites for other recipes like homemade marshmallows).
4. Heat heavy cream in medium sauce pot over medium heat until it reaches 158°F / 70°C.
5. Add chocolate pieces and allow them to melt while stirring slowly.
6. Blend melted chocolate and heated heavy cream with immersion blender on low until smooth.
7. Remove pot from heat.
8. Add sugar, salt, and eggs yolks to pot while stirring slowly.
9. Blend all ingredients in pot with with immersion blender on low until smooth.
10. Place fine-mesh strainer over bowl and strain the mixture into it.
11. Rest for 30min to allow for air bubbles to rise to the surface
12. Skim off any air bubbles that remain on surface after rest time
13. Fill each jar to about 0.5 inches (1.25cm) from the top.
14. If any air bubbles appear, tap filled jar on surface gently until they burst
15. Seal each jar with lid - tightening to only "fingertip tight" (see note below).
16. Lower jars into at-temperature water and make sure they are fully submerged.
17. Allow jars to cook via sous vide for 1 hour.
18. Remove jars from water. Dry and place them in the fridge to chill until cold (overnight or the day before is best).
19. Serve from fridge and top with Oreo Cookie Crumble (below), whipped cream, or other toppings.

### Oreo Cookie Crumble

1. Melt butter over medium-low heat in a small sauce pan/pot.
2. Remove cream filling from Oreo cookies (with a knife, not one's tongue).
3. Add Oreo cookies and salt into food processor.
4. Begin to slowly drizzle melted butter into food processor while pulsing ingredients.
5. Stop pulsing when all butter is mixed in AND cookie crumble pieces are the size of dimes or small peas.
6. Store in air tight container in the fridge (for up to a week).

## Notes

**Fingertip Tight** &mdash; This is a rough one to describe. In general many folks adhere to the following&hellip;

1. Put the band on top of the canning jar and lid.
2. Turn it until you feel resistance.
3. Turn one-quarter more then stop.
4. Once the ring stops turning freely – and you don’t want to put too much pressure on it – then it’s tight enough.
