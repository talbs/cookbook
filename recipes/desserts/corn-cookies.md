## Directions

1. Combine the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the
paddle attachment and cream together on medium-high for 2 to 3min.
2. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the egg, and beat for 7 to 8min.
3. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour, corn flour, corn powder,
baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix just until the dough comes together,
no longer than 1min. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
4. Using a 2.75-ounce ice cream scoop (or a 0.67 cup measure), portion out the
dough onto a parchment-lined sheet pan.
5. Pat the tops of the cookie dough domes flat.
6. Wrap the sheet pan tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at
least 1hr, or up to 1wk (do not bake your cookies from room temperature--
they will not bake properly).
7. Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
8. Arrange the chilled dough a minimum of 4in apart on parchment- or
Silpat-lined sheet pans. Bake for 18min. The cookies will puff, crackle,
and spread. After 18min, they should be faintly browned on the edges yet
still bright yellow in the center; give them an extra 1min if not.
8. Cool the cookies completely on the sheet pans before transferring to a
plate or to an airtight container for storage.

## Notes

* The chefs at Milk Bar make freeze-dried corn powder by grinding freeze-dried corn. You can find freeze-dried corn at Whole Foods, Amazon.com, or JustTomatoes.com. Store leftover powder in an airtight container so it won't absorb moisture.
* At room temp, the cookies will keep fresh for 5 days; in the freezer, they will keep for 1 month.
