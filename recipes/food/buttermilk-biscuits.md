## Notes

* Cutting the butter into the flour with a food processor ensures that it is incorporated rapidly before it has time to soften or smear.
* Using a rubber spatula to bring the dough together builds in extra-flaky layers before you even roll.
* Laminating the dough by folding it over itself a few times delivers even more flaky layers.
* To make Cheddar Cheese and Scallion Biscuits: In Step 9, sprinkle 6 ounces grated cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup sliced scallions over the 12-inch dough square before folding it the second time, and continue as directed.

## Ingredients

* 0.5 cup buttermilk
* 0.5 cup sour cream

* 10 ounces all-purpose flour, plus additional for dusting

## Directions

1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 425°F.
2. Whisk together the buttermilk and sour cream in a small bowl.
3. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and process until blended, about 2 seconds.
4. Scatter the cold butter evenly over the flour and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal and the largest butter pieces are about 0.25 inch at their widest. Transfer to a large bowl.
5. Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture and fold with a rubber spatula until just combined.
6. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead until it just comes together, adding extra flour as necessary.
7. With a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 12-inch square.
8.  Using a bench scraper, fold the right third of the dough over the center, then fold the left third over so you end up with a 12-by-4-inch rectangle. Fold the top third down over the center, then fold the bottom third up so the whole thing is reduced to a 4-inch square.
9. Press the square down and roll it out again into a 12-inch square. Repeat the folding process once more. (See note above for Cheddar Cheese and Scallion variation.)
10. Roll the dough again into a 12-inch square.
11. Cut six 4-inch rounds out of the dough with a floured biscuit cutter. Transfer the rounds to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Form the dough scraps into a ball and knead gently 2 or 3 times, until smooth. Roll the dough out until it’s large enough to cut out 2 more 4-inch rounds, and transfer to the baking sheet.
12. Brush the tops of the biscuits with the melted butter.
13. Bake until golden brown and well risen, about 15 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through.
14. Allow to cool for 5 minutes and serve.
